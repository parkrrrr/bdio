# Display definition for Cebra : Cebra


# RLP: This one is interesting. It's a modular display, so it can have lots of different configurations.
# It also appears to have two rows of routers, but bdio can only support what brltty supports.

# I have commented out the '2' versions of all of the keys. They would exist if you had two dpad/button 
# modules attached. I will try to remember to revisit this config when I've added support for optional 
# hardware.
