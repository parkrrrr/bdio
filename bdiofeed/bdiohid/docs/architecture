
Main thread sets up listeners, then goes into a message-processing loop

Messages: 
    input received from brltty
    output received from host


brltty thread is the listener thread created in brlapi_interface.cpp. It will call a callback that posts a message to the main thread.

host thread is a similar listener thread that watches for output from the gadget driver, packages it in a ByteString, and sends it to 
its handlers. One of those handlers posts it to the main thread.


Primary classes:

BrlApiInterface
    (implemented)

Reports
    ctor takes a BrlApiInterface& and uses the driver/model/cellCount plus sqlite db to build a model
    std::string GetReportDescriptor
    std::string GetManufacturer
    std::string GetModel
    std::map<unsigned int, std::string> GetStrings
    unsigned int GetMaxReportSize

    ByteString GetInputReport
    void SetButton(press, group, key)

    SetOutputReport(ByteString)

Gadget
    ctor takes a Reports& and sets up a HID device with its report descriptor
    SendInputReport(ByteString)
    ListenerToken AddOutputListener(function)
    RemoveOutputListener(ListenerToken)
